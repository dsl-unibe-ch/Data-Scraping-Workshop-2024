    "# Some Important Concepts\n",
    "1. **Waiting**: Sometimes the web application needs time for processing. If we try to access the page before the application is in a valid state, we might get an error. (Usually TimeoutError). Selenium provides two waiting strategies\n",
    "    1. **Implicit Waits**: This is a global setting that applies to every element location call for the entire session. If an implicit wait is set, the driver will wait for the duration of the provided value before returning an error, if the element is not fopund. However, if the element is located, the driver will return the element reference immediate and further code will continue executing, so a larger implicit wait value won’t necessarily increase the duration of the session.\n",
    "    ```driver.implicitly_wait(10)``` implies that the driver should wait for 10 seconds before returning an error.\n",
    "    2. **Explicit Waits**: These are loops that check that a condition criteria is true before proceeding to futher code execution. If the condition is not met, a timeout error is returned.\n",
    "        1. ```wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)``` implies a timeout should be performed after 10 seconds if the condition is not fulfilled.\n",
    "        2. ```element = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, xpath_login)))``` implies waiting until the [expected conditions](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/support_features/expected_conditions/) for checking an element is visible and enabled such that you can click it is met. An element is retuned if the the conditions are met.\n",
    "   More details can be found [here](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/waits/).\n",
    "2. ** Finding Elements**: Selenim offers [several attributes](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/locating-elements.html) in the BY class which can be used for finding elements. \n",
    "    1. ID = \"id\" &emsp; ```find_element(By.ID, \"id\")```\n",
    "    2. NAME = \"name\" &emsp; ```find_element(By.NAME, \"name\")```\n",
    "    3. XPATH = \"xpath\" &emsp; ```find_element(By.XPATH, \"xpath\")```\n",
    "    4. LINK_TEXT = \"link text\" &emsp; ```find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, \"link text\")```\n",
    "    5. PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT = \"partial link text\" &emsp; ```find_element(By.PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT, \"partial link text\")```\n",
    "    6. TAG_NAME = \"tag name\" &emsp; ```find_element(By.TAG_NAME, \"tag name\")```\n",
    "    7. CLASS_NAME = \"class name\" &emsp; ```find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, \"class name\")```\n",
    "    8. CSS_SELECTOR = \"css selector\" &emsp; ```find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, \"css selector\")```\n",
    "    9. Multiple elements can be found by ```element.find_elements(By.NAME, \"name\")```\n",
    "3. **Giving Inputs**: Form elements can be provided with text using ```element.send_keys(\"Some Text\")```  "
